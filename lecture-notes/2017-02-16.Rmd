## Today's reading

- [Hubel, D. H.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Hubel), & [Wiesel, T. N.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_Wiesel) (1962). Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat’s visual cortex. The Journal of Physiology, 160(1), 106–154. https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1962.sp006837

## Questions to ponder

- What did they do?
- What did they find?
- Why should we care?

## Other questions to ponder

- What's the goal of visual neuroscience?
- What's a receptive field?
- What made 'simple' cells simple?
    + How were cortical 'simple' cells different from LGN and retinal cells?
- What made 'complex' cells complex?

## More questions to ponder

- How does the size of receptive fields vary?
- What is direction selectivity?
- What is ocular dominance?
