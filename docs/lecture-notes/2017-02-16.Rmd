## Questions to ponder

- What did they do?
- What did they find?
- Why should we care?

## Other questions to ponder

- What's the goal of visual neuroscience?
- What's a receptive field?
- What made 'simple' cells simple?
    + How were cortical 'simple' cells different from LGN and retinal cells?
- What made 'complex' cells complex?

## More questions to ponder

- How does the size of receptive fields vary?
- What is direction selectivity?
- What is ocular dominance?

## Key points

  > "...with the exception of afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate body we have found no units with concentric 'on'-centre or 'off'-centre fields." p.109
  
  > "...By trial and error with many shapes of stimulus it was discovered that the cell's firing could be influenced by a horizontally oriented slit..." p. 114
  
  > "In describing simple fields it has already been noted that moving stimuli were often more effective than stationary ones. This was also true of cells with complex fields." p. 121
  
---

  > "...in both geniculate and cortex the field dimensions tend to increase with distance from the area centralis, and that they differ even for a given location in the retina." p. 122
  
  > "...the only differences ever seen between the two fields were related to eye dominance: identical stimuli to the two eyes did not necessarily evoke equally strong responses from a given cell." p. 124
  
  > "...the striate cortex is divided into discrete regions within which the cells have a common receptive-field axis orientation." p. 133
  
---

  > "Cells with simple fields were most numerous in layers 3, 4 and 6. Especially interesting is the apparent rarity of complex fields in layer 4, where simple fields were so abundant." p. 139

  > "We may tentatively look upon each column as a functional unit of cortex, within which simple fields are elaborated and then in turn synthesized into complex fields." p. 144
